## 📄 Dataset Description

> Asking a home buyer to describe their dream house typically doesn’t start with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. However, this dataset from a playground competition reveals that many more factors influence price negotiations than just the number of bedrooms or a white picket fence.

This assignment utilizes a dataset containing **79 explanatory variables** that describe almost every aspect of residential homes in **Ames, Iowa**.  
Your challenge is to predict the final price of each home based on these variables.  
All necessary information to understand each column is included in a separate file.

## 🎯 Objective

Your task is to perform a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and preprocessing of the given dataset.  
This should include handling missing values, visualizing data through various plots, and applying feature engineering techniques.

## ✅ Tasks

### 1️⃣ Loading Data and Libraries (10%)
- Load the dataset and import all necessary libraries.

### 2️⃣ Preprocessing

- Conduct initial data cleaning and preparation steps.

  #### 🔹 Data Description (10%)
  ▪ Provide a brief description of the dataset, including the shape, data types, and an overview of the variables.

  #### 🔹 Handling Missing Values (20%)
  ▪ Identify and handle missing values appropriately. Document your approach and rationale.

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (30%)

- Create various plots to visualize the data. This should include:
